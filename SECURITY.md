## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any vulnerabilities you should open a ticket with the prefix "Vulnerability - ".
If you do not use said prefix i might go over the vulnerability and it might not get fixed.
You should expect updates on a reported vulnerability every day at best and at worst every week.
If a vulnerability report is accepted then I will reply to the ticket saying I accepted it.
This means I am actively working on fixing the vulnerability. Once fixed, the ticket will
be closed.
If a vulnerability report is declined I will reply that i could not replicate the vulnerability. Then i will close the ticket.
